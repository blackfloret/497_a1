We initially attempted to implement PostgreSQL due to familiarity, but ended
up running into more issues than necessary, so switched over to MySql. 

The most challenging part of this assignment was implementing session
storing with Redis, this was the point we decided to switch to MySql because of
the challenges. We used a mixture of the slides, lecture recordings and external
sources to solve our issues.
